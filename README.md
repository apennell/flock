## Technologies 

This uses HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, jQuery, and Twitter Bootstrap.

## Dependencies
* Sass ([get it here](http://sass-lang.com/install))

## Instructions

1. Clone locally using `git clone https://github.com/apennell/flock.git`
2. `cd` into `flock` directory
3. To view the todo list, `cd` into `todo` and open `index.html` in your browser

## Next Steps

### Todo List

* I would like to implement a styled custom date-picker and allow for fallbacks when HTML5 is unavailable
* In working toward making this a functional todo list app, I would like to convert it to a ReactJS setup with a form component and a list component that is made up of todo items
* Test to validate data input in todo form
* Display error if input is invalid
* Click circle icon on list to complete item
