This project includes a static todo list, including a form for adding a new todo item and a table with rows for each item. Each todo item includes a name (string), a topic (array of strings), due date (date), and completed (boolean).

## Technologies 

This uses HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, and Twitter Bootstrap.

## Dependencies
* Sass ([get it here](http://sass-lang.com/install))

## Instructions

1. Clone locally using `git clone https://github.com/apennell/flock.git`
2. `cd` into `flock` directory
3. To view the todo list, `cd` into `todo` and open `index.html` in your browser
4. To view the answer to problem 2, view `Problem2.md`

## Next Steps

### Todo List

* I would like to implement a styled custom date-picker and allow for fallbacks when HTML5 is unavailable
* In working toward making this a functional todo list app, I would like to convert it to a ReactJS setup with a form component and a list component that is made up of todo items
* Implement testing to validate data input in todo form
* Display error if input is invalid
* Click circle icon on list to complete item

### Calculator
* With more time, I would start and complete a calculator Javascript object!
* *Note:* I created a calculator API using Express and Node years ago, although it utilizes route params rather than objects. It can be viewed [here](https://github.com/apennell/Calculator-HW).
